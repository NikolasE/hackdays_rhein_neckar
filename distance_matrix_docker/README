This directory contains a dockerized script to compute a distance matrix through the HERE-API.

If run locally, pip install the requirements. The scripts expects the following files in the data-repository:

keys.yaml: 
  Contains the app_id and app_code which can be generated for free(!) on the HERE-Website. (so please get your own)

positions.csv:
  Contains a list of labels and coordinates, should look like this (if you are around Germany)

id_0, 51.099399, 14.671359
id_1, 51.099552, 14.671325
id_2, 52.298212, 9.635192
id_3, 48.999396, 9.500320
id_4, 48.999558, 9.500395
id_5, 50.068284, 8.632652

(If you wonder, these are positions of elevators operated by Deutsche Bahn, so some of those are very close to each other) 

The scripts computes all distances (assuming symmetric distances) for a travel by car without traffic. 


If you do not want to install the dependencies (it's only yaml and request...), you can build the container via


docker build --tag=distance .  (in the base directory)

and execute it like this:

docker run -v  /home/engelhard/Documents/distance_matrix_docker/data:/data    -u `id -u $USER` distance

the '-v' part passes the data directory into the container and the '-u' ensures that the generated output file belongs to the current user instread of root.
